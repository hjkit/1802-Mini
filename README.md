# 1802-Mini
This is a modular, expandable, 1802-based computer envisioned for uses from an SBC to eventually a multi-user timesharing system. Inspired by the [RC1802-Cosmac-ELF](https://github.com/tebl/1802-Cosmac-ELF) but improved in many ways and with added expansion capabilities.

I have split this project into separate repositories for each 1802/Mini card (and for lack of a better understanding of git) and am just linking to them in this README.md file for now. This main project contains some common documentation.
