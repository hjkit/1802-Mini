# super-elf-elfos-410-install-v1.img

This is the same code and features as the 1802/Mini BIOS with 1854 support except it is built for a clock rate of 1.79 KHz and a fixed bit-banged UART speed of 1200 baud so that it will work with the Quest Super Elf. All other notes from the 1802/Mini version apply, so please see the notes on that also:

https://github.com/dmadole/1802-Mini/blob/master/firmware/1802-mini-elfos-410-install-v1.md

Note in relation to those notes, that on the Super Elf, EF4 is asserted with the I key, so to enter the ROM install menu on reset, hold the I key while pressing the M key.
