# super-elf-elfos-410-install-v1.img

This is the same code and features as the 1802/Mini BIOS with 1854 support except it is built for a clock rate of 1.79 KHz and a fixed bit-banged UART speed of 1200 baud so that it will work with the Quest Super Elf. All other notes from the 1802/Mini version apply, so please see the notes on that also:
